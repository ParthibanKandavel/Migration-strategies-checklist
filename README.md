# Migration-strategies-checklist
Things to do for migrating platforms for data storage analysis and reporting 

Migrating from SAS on Teradata to Python on GCP (BigQuery) is a major shift — not just technically, but also in terms of workflow, mindset, and architecture. You need to plan across code, data, performance, and team enablement.

Here’s a complete action plan broken down into 5 key areas:

---

✅ 1. Assessment & Inventory

Action	Description

📦 Catalog all existing SAS programs	Identify all .sas programs, EG projects, and stored procedures
🔍 Classify by type	Reporting, ETL, analytics, modeling, audit reports, data quality
🧾 Track data sources	Teradata tables, flat files, DB links
⏱ Measure frequency & scheduling	Daily/weekly/monthly jobs, triggers (e.g., Control-M, cron)
💡 Understand business logic	Document business rules in plain English
🧪 Identify critical jobs	Flag high-impact jobs needed for go-live (MVP scope)

---

✅ 2. SAS to Python Migration Plan

Task	Tools/Approach

🧾 Translate SAS logic to Python	Use pandas, numpy, and sqlalchemy for logic/dataframes
🧠 Replace PROC SQL with Python SQLAlchemy or direct BQ queries	Ensure query translation with parameterization
📦 Use pandas.read_sas() or sas7bdat to inspect test SAS datasets	For validation
🛠 Handle macros/loops carefully	Convert to Python functions or Jinja templates
📉 Migrate statistical models (PROC REG, LOGISTIC, etc.)	Use statsmodels, sklearn, scipy in Python
📊 ODS / Report output	Use Jupyter, PDF generation, or BI tools (Looker, Tableau

---

✅ 3. Teradata to BigQuery Migration

Step	Details

📦 Export data from Teradata	As CSV or Parquet (use BTEQ scripts or TPT for batch exports)
🚚 Stage in GCS	Use GCS buckets as landing zone
🏗 Use bq load or Dataflow to move into BigQuery	Batch or streaming depending on frequency
🔍 Map data types carefully	Teradata → BigQuery (watch for CHAR/DECIMAL/DATE mismatches)
📈 Optimize partitioning and clustering	For performance and cost savings
🛠 Use BigQuery SQL syntax conversion	Adjust WHERE, QUALIFY, OLAP functions, etc.

---

✅ 4. Orchestration & CI/CD

Tool	Purpose

Apache Airflow (Cloud Composer)	DAGs for scheduling Python code and BQ SQL
Git + CI/CD (Cloud Build / GitLab)	Code versioning, auto deploy notebooks/scripts
Monitoring	Integrate Stackdriver/Cloud Logging with alerts
IAM roles	Set access control for datasets, buckets, services

--

✅ 5. Testing, Validation & Enablement

Area	Actions

✅ Parallel run	Run SAS & Python in parallel for output comparison
🧪 Unit tests	Write Pytest-based tests to validate business logic
📊 Reconciliation	Record count, column-level validation, summary statistics
📚 Documentation	Markdown or Confluence docs to show how code works
🤝 Team training	On Python coding patterns, BigQuery best practices, and data modeling in BQ

-Summary Action Checklist

Area	Action

SAS Code	Translate macros, data steps, and PROC SQL into Python...
Teradata Data	Export → GCS → Load to BigQuery with schema validation...
Scheduling	Migrate from Control-M to Airflow/Cloud Composer
Validation	Run parallel runs and automate data comparison
Architecture	Define staging, raw, and curated layers in BigQuery
Enablement	Mentor users and document reusable templates
